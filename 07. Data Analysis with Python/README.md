# 📊 Data Analysis with Python

## 📄 Summary

This repository chronicles the intellectual and technical expedition undertaken during the "Data Analysis with Python" course, a pivotal module within the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

The curriculum orchestrates a symphony of Python tools and techniques to analyze multifarious datasets. From the humble act of data ingestion to the intellectually exhilarating task of predictive modeling, this series of Jupyter Notebooks offers an exhaustive, methodically documented roadmap.

The culmination of this voyage is a capstone assignment: **predicting real estate market prices** using an extensive and intricate dataset — a practical application of the principles of statistical learning and regression modeling.

Notably, certain expansive topics such as **data wrangling** are accorded supplemental notebooks due to their breadth and depth, demonstrating the rigour and richness of this analytical endeavour.
