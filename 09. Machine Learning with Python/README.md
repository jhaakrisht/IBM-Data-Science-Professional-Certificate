# 🤖 Machine Learning with Python

## 📄 Summary

This folder encapsulates a comprehensive journey through the foundational concepts and practical applications of **Machine Learning**, undertaken as a part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

The course offers not merely a perfunctory overview, but a deep dive into the **philosophy, utility, and real-world manifestation** of machine learning paradigms. From the dichotomy of supervised versus unsupervised learning, to the nuanced intricacies of algorithmic evaluation, the learning path is rich with theory and practice.

Throughout the course, multiple illustrative use-cases are dissected — from **cancer detection** and **economic forecasting** to **customer churn prediction** and **recommendation engines** — each reinforcing a specific technique or model.

The capstone assignment is a compelling classification challenge: **predicting loan repayment outcomes**, using a suite of algorithms including **K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines**, and **Logistic Regression**, to evaluate and determine the optimal predictive strategy.
