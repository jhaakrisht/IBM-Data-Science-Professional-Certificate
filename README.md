## 🛠️ Tools Utilized

Throughout this certification, the following state-of-the-art tools and platforms were employed:

- `Python`  
- `Jupyter Notebooks`  
- `Git & GitHub`  
- `IBM Watson Studio`  
- `IBM Cloud Pak for Data`  

These instruments constituted the digital laboratory in which insights were uncovered, models built, and predictions tested.

## 📖 Libraries & Frameworks

A veritable arsenal of Python libraries was leveraged to explore, analyze, and visualize data with fluency and finesse:

- `pandas` • `numpy` • `matplotlib` • `seaborn`  
- `scikit-learn` • `scipy` • `folium`  
- `dash` • `plotly` • `sqlalchemy`

These libraries enabled both granular control over data manipulation and high-level abstraction for modeling and deployment.
