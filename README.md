## 📖 Libraries & Frameworks

A veritable arsenal of Python libraries was leveraged to explore, analyze, and visualize data with fluency and finesse:

- `pandas` • `numpy` • `matplotlib` • `seaborn`  
- `scikit-learn` • `scipy` • `folium`  
- `dash` • `plotly` • `sqlalchemy`

These libraries enabled both granular control over data manipulation and high-level abstraction for modeling and deployment.
