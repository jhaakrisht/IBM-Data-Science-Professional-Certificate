# 🗄️ Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

## 📄 Summary

This course introduces the principles of **relational databases** and teaches the foundational elements of **SQL** — the lingua franca of structured data manipulation. Through hands-on labs and real-world datasets, learners gain practical experience querying, modifying, and managing databases using SQL, both independently and in conjunction with Python.

The course further integrates **Python’s DB-API** and SQL Magic commands, reinforcing the synergy between programming and database operations in data science workflows.
