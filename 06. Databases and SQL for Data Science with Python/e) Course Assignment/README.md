# 🏙️ Chicago Census, Crime, and School Data Analysis using SQL

## 📚 Context & Purpose

As part of the rigorous IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, this analytical odyssey immerses one in the complex civic tapestry of the City of Chicago. Assuming the mantle of a data analyst for a benevolent non-profit organisation, I endeavoured to distil actionable insights from the confluence of **census**, **crime**, and **educational performance data**. The overarching mission? To illuminate the socio-economic factors that imperil or promote scholastic success, safety, and well-being amongst Chicago's youth.

This project encapsulates the judicious application of **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to navigate and interrogate sprawling datasets, uncovering truths that numbers whisper and policies often overlook.

## 🧭 Methodology

1. **Acquisition** of authentic datasets from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/).
2. **Ingestion** into a robust relational database management system (RDBMS).
3. **Interrogation** via meticulously crafted SQL queries.
4. **Documentation** through visual evidence (screenshots) and a well-annotated Jupyter Notebook.

## 🗃️ Datasets Utilised

Three distinct yet interrelated datasets from the municipal archives of Chicago:

### 1. Socioeconomic Indicators
A revealing compendium of six pivotal public health metrics and a hardship index, organised by community area (2008–2012).

### 2. Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Performance
A granular breakdown of school-level data underpinning CPS Report Cards for the academic year 2011–2012.

### 3. Chicago Crime Data
A sprawling register of reported criminal infractions (2001 to present), save for the most recent septenary of days.

## 💡 Analytical Objectives

The entirety of the SQL analysis — accompanied by screenshots and visual corroborations — is encapsulated in the notebook [accessible here](#) _(link to be added)_.

The queries address the following multifaceted inquiries:

1. **Quantification** of crimes: What is the totality of offences documented in the `CRIME` table?
2. **Socioeconomic plight**: Which community areas subsist with a per capita income below $11,000?
3. **Juvenile justice**: Which case numbers pertain to crimes involving minors?
4. **Child endangerment**: Which kidnapping incidents specifically reference children?
5. **Academic adversity**: What crimes have transpired within the sanctified precincts of schools?
6. **Safety scrutiny**: What is the average safety score across the educational spectrum?
7. **Poverty prevalence**: Which five community areas exhibit the highest proportion of households beneath the poverty threshold?
8. **Criminological epicentre**: Which community area (by numeric designation) endures the greatest criminological burden?
9. **Hardship hegemony**: Via sub-query, identify the community area reigning with the highest hardship index.
10. **Crime capital**: Through nested logic, ascertain the community area most besieged by criminal occurrences.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This analytical foray into the socio-educational matrix of Chicago, mediated through SQL, unveils patterns that are not merely statistical artefacts, but clarion calls for civic reform and community upliftment. The intersection of data science and public policy holds the potential to transmute insight into impact — and this project is a modest step in that noble direction.
