## 🧠 My Definition of Data Science

> **Data Science** is the discipline of extracting meaningful insights from data — often vast and varied in form — to address complex problems, inform strategic decisions, and generate tangible value.

It encompasses the entire data lifecycle: from acquisition and cleaning, to analysis, modeling, and the deployment of solutions. Data scientists operate at this intersection of statistics, programming, and domain expertise, wielding scientific methods with analytical rigor.

Yet beyond code and algorithms lies a subtler craft — **storytelling**. The most effective data scientists are also adept communicators, capable of weaving data into narratives that clarify, convince, and catalyze action.
