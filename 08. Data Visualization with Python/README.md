# 📊 Data Visualization with Python

## 📄 Summary

This repository encapsulates my foray into the realm of **data visualization**, undertaken as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The course emphasizes the paramount importance of **transforming abstruse datasets into visual narratives** that elucidate hidden insights and empower informed decision-making.

Harnessing the prowess of libraries such as **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, and **Folium**, the course traverses the art and science of crafting compelling graphical representations. A special focus is laid upon **Canadian immigration trends**, culminating in an immersive capstone assignment: constructing a sophisticated **interactive dashboard** that evaluates the performance of US domestic airline flights using **Plotly Dash**.

This compilation of notebooks and dashboards reflects not just technical competence, but a visual aesthetic — data, presented with clarity and elegance.
